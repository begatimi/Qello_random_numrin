# random_numri_qello
The fun and easy project “random_numri_qello” is a short Java project that allows the user to guess the number generated by the computer & involves the following steps:<br>
The system generates a random number from a given range, say 1 to 100.<br>
The user is prompted to enter their given number in a displayed dialogue box.
The computer then tells if the entered number matches the guesses number or it is higher/lower than the generated number.
The game continues under the user guessing the number.
